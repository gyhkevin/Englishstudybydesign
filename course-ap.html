                <h3>AP English Language and Composition </h3>
                <p>The AP English Language and Composition  exam consists of two sections: a one-hour multiple-choice section, and a  two-hour and fifteen-minute free-response section. </p>
                <p>The multiple-choice section contains  approximately 55 questions that are derived from 5 passages divided between  Pre-20th Century non-fiction prose, and 20th and 21st Century non-fiction  prose. The questions typically focus on identifying rhetorical devices and  structures from the passage, as well as their general function, purpose in a  passage, and/or the relationships between them.</p>
                <p>The Free-Response section of the test  consists of three prompts: synthesis, passage analysis, and argument. The  synthesis prompt requires students to consider a scenario, then formulate a  response to a specific element of the scenario using at least three of the  accompanying sources for support. The analysis prompt asks students to read a  short (less than 1 page) passage, then write an essay in which they analyze various  techniques the author uses in the passage, such as strategies, argumentative  techniques, motivations, or other rhetorical elements, and discuss how such  techniques effectively contribute to the overall purpose of the passage. The  argument prompt gives a position in the form of an assertion from a documented  source. Students are asked to consider the assertion, and then form an argument  that defends, challenges, or qualifies the assertion using supporting evidence  from their own knowledge or reading. All the essays are scored on the 1-9  scale.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>My Approach</h3>
                <p>I teach students how to break down the rhetoric and trace its characteristics from the discourses that span 3 centuries. While students are diversely exposed to what rhetoric is and how it can be effectively maneuvered to enhance the written message, they can gradually identify good rhetoric and internalize it into their own argumentation. In my AP language class, rhetoric, literature, and composition go hand in hand so that the students are expected, by the end of a series of workshops, to be able to distinguish the contextual nuances of given works of literature, as well as building up their own rhetoric in response to a controversial issue.   </p>
