    	  <p>I have long been fascinated with the beauty of teaching, which can always keep a soul connection alive by engaging learners intellectually and emotionally. I believe genuine enthusiasm is contagious, with which we instructors can extend a lifeline of empowerment to students so as to proactively and collaboratively promote, preserve, and transmit a legacy of culture, knowledge, and experience. With such convictions, I am committed to nurturing a core of strength that will carry my students through the challenges of English language learning, and, more significantly, life. </p>
    	  <p>At the heart of learning lies a passion for the English language that can be instilled only through students’ being opened up to the beauty of language and splendor of its linguistic illustrations. I often tap into audio-visual aids to stimulate senses and emotions towards otherwise obscure literary texts. Learning in that way accelerates the decoding process. Likewise, students can make sense of what they are learning by a tangible connectedness. Over the years, I have been fostering a “magical classroom” in which students receive individually tailored instruction that caters to their quintessential learning styles – visual, auditory, and/or kinesthetic, in which every student can come out of their shell and thrive as an independent learner. Through communicative and hands-on activities such as group debates, questioning and brainstorming, and collaborative writing, my students have palpable access to English reading and writing experiences. With the different learning styles of students in mind, I developed a broad range of assessment, such as quizzes, homework assignments, peer review, oral presentations, traditional tests, short papers, and collaborative group writing, to keep my students engaged and captivated while gauging their comprehension in a holistic way. I desire to incubate a learning environment that invigorates the uninterested and challenges the motivated. I also desire to create a classroom as a close-knit community where students feel and believe they have a stake in each other’s well-being rather than straining peer pressure.</p>
    	  <p>For the past two years, I’ve also been working with students one-on-one. These focused sessions have turned out to be breeding grounds for activating students’ innate language learning mechanisms and restructuring student thinking in the target language. Every single student is exposed to individually constructed ways to build an extra-linguistic, intuitive language sense as a solid foundation for sustained English language proficiency. Meanwhile, I lead my students to monitor their own progress and set new goals through one-on-one self-assessment dialogues, critical thinking activities and exploration outside of their comfort zone. The ultimate goal is to well equip students with self-directed learning attitudes and skills so that they can be transformed into lifelong learners. </p>
    	  <p>Being a language instructor for so long, I view myself more as a guide and mentor dedicated to helping students frame their aspirations and reach their fullest potential. My teaching/mentoring is rooted in a fertile place of learning, well supported in academic research, and fired by the enthusiasm of connecting with students. Watching them grow and blossom over time is the most fulfilling and rewarding part of my teaching career. <br>
